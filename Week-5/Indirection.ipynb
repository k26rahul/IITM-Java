    "## General Concept of Indirection:\n",
    "  - Fundamental in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "  - Access or reference objects through intermediate abstraction.\n",
    "  - Implemented using interfaces, abstract classes, or general references.\n",
    "  - Facilitates abstraction, flexibility, and adaptability.\n",
    "  - Allows changes in the underlying implementations without affecting client code.\n",
    "  - Closely related to principles of polymorphism and encapsulation."

    "  - The Shape interface acts as an indirection layer.\n",
    "  - Code can work with any class implementing the Shape interface.\n",
    "  - Provides flexibility without changing the client code.\n",
