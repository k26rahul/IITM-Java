    "# Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - Assertions are statements that guarantee a condition to be true in a program at a specific point.\n",
    "  - Primarily used for debugging and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax:**\n",
    "  - `assert condition;`\n",
    "  - `assert condition : expression;`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enabling Assertions:**\n",
    "  - Assertions are disabled by default in Java.\n",
    "  - To enable assertions during program execution, use the `-ea` or `-enableassertions` flag:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    java -ea Main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types of Assertions:**\n",
    "  - Simple Assertion:\n",
    "    - Asserts that a condition is true.\n",
    "      ```java\n",
    "      int x = 10;\n",
    "      assert x == 10;\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Assertion with Message:\n",
    "    - Asserts that a condition is true along with a custom error message.\n",
    "      ```java\n",
    "      int y = 20;\n",
    "      assert y == 20 : \"Value of y must be 20\";\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage:**\n",
    "  - Assertions test the correctness of assumptions made in the program.\n",
    "    - Check for conditions that should never occur if the program is functioning correctly.\n",
    "      ```java\n",
    "      int value = -10;\n",
    "      assert value >= 0 : \"Value cannot be negative\";\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If an assertion fails, JVM throws an `AssertionError`.\n",
    "    - Assertions are believed to be true while executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assertion Vs Normal Exception Handling:**\n",
    "  - Assertions vs. Exception Handling:\n",
    "    - Assertions: *Used to check logically impossible situations.*\n",
    "    - Exception Handling: *Deals with anticipated errors and exceptional situations.*\n",
    "  - Assertions are typically disabled at runtime, unlike exception handling which is active.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Catching logically impossible situations during development and testing phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Division by Zero:\n",
    "       ```java\n",
    "       int denominator = 0;\n",
    "       assert denominator != 0 : \"Denominator cannot be zero\";\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Bad Index Access:\n",
    "       ```java\n",
    "       int[] array = {1, 2, 3};\n",
    "       int index = -1;\n",
    "       assert index >= 0 && index < array.length : \"Index out of bounds\";\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Invalid Enumeration Value:\n",
    "       ```java\n",
    "       enum Day {SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY};\n",
    "       Day day = Day.SUNDAY;\n",
    "       assert day != null : \"Invalid day enumeration\";\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Incorrect Loop Bounds:\n",
    "       ```java\n",
    "       int start = 10;\n",
    "       int end = 5;\n",
    "       assert start <= end : \"Start value should be less than or equal to end value\";\n",
    "       ```"
