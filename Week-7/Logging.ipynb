    "# Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - Logging is the process of recording application activities, errors, and debug information during runtime.\n",
    "  - Essential for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Java Logging Frameworks:**\n",
    "  - Java provides several logging frameworks, including:\n",
    "    - `java.util.logging (JUL)`: Standard logging framework included in the Java Development Kit (JDK).\n",
    "    - `Log4j`: Popular third-party logging framework maintained by Apache.\n",
    "    - `Logback`: Another widely-used logging framework developed as a successor to Log4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging Levels:**\n",
    "  - Logging levels indicate the severity of a logged message.\n",
    "    - `SEVERE`: Highest severity level for critical errors that may lead to application failure.\n",
    "    - `WARNING`: Indicates potential issues or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "    - `INFO`: General information messages about application state or events.\n",
    "    - `CONFIG`: Logging of configuration-related information.\n",
    "    - `FINE`, `FINER`, `FINEST`: Detailed debugging information.\n",
    "    - `ALL`, `OFF`: Special levels for enabling/disabling logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging Configuration:**\n",
    "  - Logging configuration can be managed through configuration files or programmatically.\n",
    "  - Configuration files like `logging.properties` in JUL or `log4j2.xml` in Log4j allow fine-tuning of logging behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging Statements:**\n",
    "  - Log messages are generated using various logging methods provided by the logging frameworks.\n",
    "    - Example using JUL:\n",
    "      ```java\n",
    "      import java.util.logging.Logger;\n",
    "      \n",
    "      public class MyClass {\n",
    "          private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());\n",
    "          \n",
    "          public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "              logger.info(\"Application started.\");\n",
    "              // Other application logic\n",
    "              logger.warning(\"Unexpected behavior detected.\");\n",
    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Handlers:**\n",
    "  - Log handlers determine where the log messages should be outputted.\n",
    "    - Handlers can write logs to console, files, databases, or remote servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best Practices:**\n",
    "  - Use meaningful log messages with proper logging levels to facilitate effective troubleshooting.\n",
    "  - Avoid excessive logging, as it may impact performance and readability of logs.\n"
