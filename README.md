# IITM BS Java, T1 2024

I'm not enrolled in this course for this term, but I'm studying the syllabus out of curiosity.

Week-wise folders contain Java code files to practice concepts and notebook files with notes prepared by me.

If you're learning, it's best to read concepts from those notes and then take a look at the practice/demo Java files.

- [Java-Exercises:](./Java-Exercises/) Contains solved Java problems.
- [BankingSystem:](./BankingSystem/) Complete code of a simple banking system in Java, with tutorial notebooks to guide your practice.
- [PDFs:](./PDFs/) Folder containing useful PDFs on various topics.
- [course-outline-programming-concepts-using-java.pdf:](./course-outline-programming-concepts-using-java.pdf) Overview of week-wise concepts covered in the course.
